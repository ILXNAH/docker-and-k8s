## ðŸ“š Quiz Questions & Answers

**What are "Images" (when working with Docker)?**
- Images are blueprints for containers which then are running instances with read and write access.

---

**Why do we have "Images" and "Containers"? Why not just "Containers"?**
- This concept allows multiple containers to be based on the same image without interfering with each other.

---

**What does "Isolation" mean in the context of containers?**
- Containers are separated from each other and have no shared data or state by default.

---

**What's a "Container"?**
- An isolated unit of software which is based on an image. A running instance of that image.

---

**What are "Layers" in the context of images?**
- Every instruction in an image creates a cacheable layer â€” layers help with image re-building and sharing.

---

**What does this command do?**

```bash
docker build .
```
- It builds an image.

---

**What does this command do?**

```bash
docker run node
```
- It creates and runs a container based on the "node" image.

---

**What's the result of these commands?**

1. `docker build -t myimage .`
2. `docker run --name mycontainer myimage`
3. `docker stop mycontainer`

- An image is created, a container is started and then stopped. Both, image and container, have a name assigned by the developer.

---

**Assume that these commands were executed:**

1. `docker build -t myimage:latest .`
2. `docker run --name mycontainer --rm myimage`
3. `docker stop mycontainer`

Which of the below commands will fail?
- `docker rm mycontainer`

---

**What's the idea behind image tags?**
- An image can have a name and then multiple "versions" of that image attached on the same name.

---

**Do you have to assign custom image tags and container names?**
- No, Docker auto-assigns names and IDs.

---

**What's a "Volume" (when working with Docker)?**
- A folder/file inside of a Docker container which is connected to some folder outside of the container.

---

**Which statement is correct?**
- Volumes are managed by Docker, you don't necessarily know where the host folder (which is mapped to a container-internal path) is.

---

**What's true about Anonymous Volumes?**
- They are removed when a container, that was started with "--rm" is stopped.

---

**What's the advantage of "Named Volumes"?**
- They survive container removal.

---

**What's a "Bind Mount"?**
- A path on your host machine, which you know and specified, that is mapped to some container-internal path.

---

**What's a typical use-case for a "Bind Mount"?**
- You want to provide "live data" to the container (no rebuilding needed).

---

**Are Anonymous Volumes useless?**
- No, you can use them to prioritize container-internal paths higher than external paths.
