## Module Introduction
- docker core concepts
- docker on local host machine (dev)
- docker on remote hosts (dep/prod)
## Images & Containers
### Docker core concepts
- containers
	- isolated
	- single-task-focused
	- shareable, reproducible
	- stateless (+volume) => data will be lost when shut down
	- created with images
	- **read-write layer on top of image**
- images
	- created with Dockerfiles or pulled from registry (docker hub)
	- blueprints for containers
	-  contain (app) code + environment
	- read-only / image itself does not run
	- **created with instructions (layers)**

## Key Commands
**build image based on a Dockerfile:**
`docker build -t NAME(=name+version of an image):TAG(=build context)`  

**run a container based on remote/local image:** 
`docker run --name NAME --rm -d IMAGE`

**sharing images via registry:** 
`docker push REPO/NAME:TAG`
`docker pull REPO/NAME:TAG``

## Data, volumes, networking
- **containers are isolated**
	- use bind-mounts to connect to host machine folders
	- `-v /local/path:/container/path/`
- **containers are stateless**
	- use volumes to persist data 
	- `-v NAME:/container/path`

**Docker containers & network**
- containers can be connected to send requests to each other (e.g. HTTP)
	- determine container IP and use that (although IP might change)
	- rather create a Docker network and add both containers
		- containers can use each other's names as request addresses

## Docker vs. Docker Compose
- repeating long `docker build` and `docker run` commands gets annoying - especially when working with multiple containers
	- **Docker Compose** allows you to pre-define build and run config in a .yaml file 
		- `docker-compose up` build missing images and start all containers
		- `docker-compose down` stop all started containers

## Local Host (dev) vs. Remote Host (prod)
### Local (dev)
- isolated, encapsuled, reproducible dev envs
- no dependency or software clashes
### Deployment is optional
- it is OK to use Docker/Docker Compose for local dev
	- encapsulated envs for diff projects
	- no global installation of tools
	- easy to share and re-produce
### Remote (prod)
- isolated, encapsulated, reproducible envs
- easy updates => replace existing running container with an updated one

## Deployment Considerations
- replace **bind-mounts** with **Volumes** or COPY **instructions** within `Dockerfile`
- multiple containers might need **multiple hosts**
	- but they can also run on the **same host** (depends on app)
- **multi-stage builds** help with apps that need a build step

- control vs. ease of use 
	- full control = you need to manage everything
	- managed services = less control & extra knowledge required, easier to use, less responsibility
