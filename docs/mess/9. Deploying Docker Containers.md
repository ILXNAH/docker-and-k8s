# 9. Deploying Docker Containers
##  Table of Contents

---

## Module Content 
- Deployment overview & general process
- Deployment scenarios, examples & problems

## From Development To Production
- a container:
	- standardized unit for shipping goods
	- independent from other containers
	- self-containing
	- can be moved
- independent for --> different dev & prod environment 
	- the goal is replica in both dev and prod - prod works exactly as designed in test
	- isolated, standalone environment is beneficial in both dev & prod
	- reproducible environment, easy to share and use
- > no surprises! 

### Things To Watch Out For 
- **bind mounts should not** be used in Prod
- apps might need a different setup in test & prod -  e.g. React apps **might need a build step**
- **multi-container projects** might need to be **split**
- **trade-offs** between **control** and **responsibility** might be worth it

## Deployment Process & Providers
### First Example: Standalone NodeJS App 
- no database
- just one image, nothing else

#### Possible deployment approach 
- install Docker on remote host (e.g. via SSH)
- push image from dev machine and pull image  from container registry to remote host
- run container based on image on remote host

**Cloud Service Providers (CSPs):**
	- AWS
	- Azure
	- Google Cloud

## Getting Started With An Example
### Deploy to AWS EC2
AWS EC2 is a service that allows you to spin up and manage your own remote machines;
1. **create and launch EC2 instance**, VPC (virtual public cloud) and security group
2. **configure security group** to expose all required ports to WWW
3. **connect** to instance (SSH), **install Docker** and **run container**

 - docker build -t node-dep-example .
 - docker run -d --rm --name node-dep -p 80:80 node-dep-example

## Bind Mounts In Prod
### Bind Mounts, Volumes &  COPY 
**In Development**
- containers should encapsulate the runtime env but not necessarily the code
- use bind mounts to provide local files to the container
- allow for instant updates

**In Production**
- a container should really work standalone, you should NOT have source code on your remote machine
	- image/container is the "single source of truth"
- use COPY to copy a code snapshot into the image - if used in Dockerfile without docker-compose it stays the same from dev
- ensures image runs w/o extra config or code

## Introducing AWS & EC2
## Connecting to an EC2 instance
1. create and launch EC2 instance, VPC and sec groups
2. config sec groups
3. connect to instance (SSH), install Docker, run container

- choosing Amazon Image (AMI)
- network - select VPS, leave rest of config
- instance type t2.micro
- key pair is needed to connect via SSH
- in linux then just use ssh cmd, in wins use wsl or putty
- AWS -> connect to your instance -> go through the set of instructions
	- chmod for key etc.
	- provides specific ssh command to copy paste directly
- on ec2 instance install docker 

## Installing Docker on EC2 VM
1. sudo yum update -y
2. sudo yum -y install docker
3. sudo service docker start
4. sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
5. log out, log in
6. sudo systemctl enable docker
7. docker version
- for other providers follow official Linux setup instructions [here]([https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

##  Push local image to Cloud
- option 1 - deploy source code 
	- build image on remote
	- push source code to remote machine, run `docker build` and then `docker run`
	- unnecessary complexity
- option 2 - deploy built image
	- build image before dep
	- just `docker run`
	- avoid unnecessary remote server work
	- use Docker Hub
		- create repo node-example-1
		- locally create .dockerignore, add `node_modules` , `Dockerfile` and `*.pem` files
		- `docker build -t node-dep-example-1 .`
		- add tag for image with docker hub username/node-dep-example-1 -> push to docker hub repo

## Running the Image on Remote Machine (EC2)
sudo docker run -d --rm  -p 80:80 username/node-dep-example-1
sudo docker ps

- by default the EC2 instance is disconnected form the WWW
- network & security -> security groups -> launch wizard -> inbound (from WWW, e.g. SSH) & outbound (to WWW, e.g. running docker commands) rules
- provided /  deployed node app is listening on port 80 (HTTP port) - remote host machine is blocking its inbound traffic
	- in AWS: edit inbound rules -> HTTP -> source=anywhere -> add a new rule -> use ipv4 public address to connect from browser
- in same manner you could do a multi-container app setup with docker-compose file

## 137.-142.
--> skipped

## Updating Managed Containers
- local changes - push to docker hub
- in AWS config: clusters -> default -> tasks -> task definition -> create new task revision --  NOTE: this creates a new public IP (workaround=domain config)
	- option 2: use update service -> select force new deploy

## Prepare multi-container app
- AWS
- NOT using docker-compose for deployment
- instead, deploying to AWS ECS manually separate parts, i.e. individual containers/services, of the (local) project's docker-compose file
- conversion from docker compose causes **loss of ability to use network placeholder names of containers in app code**
	- reason: not everything happens on one machine, not always on same machines either
		- unless containers are added in the same task - then they run on same machine and you can use `localhost` instead of network names

## Configuring NodeJS BE container
- ECS Cluster - network only
- Fargate launch type
- add `ENV MONGDB_URL=mongodb` into Dockerfile // `.env`+`docker-compose`

## Deploy a 2nd container + load balancer
- configure service in AWS with VPS & subnets & app LB
- security groups -> configure routing -> create LB
- map the created LB and map it to the BE container -> create service

## 147.-148.
--> skipped

## Dev to Prod
- no bind mounts
- might need a build step
- multi container projects might need to be split across more hosts, in this case using MongoDB Atlas to "outsource" DB and keep single container structure in AWS
- trade offs between control and responsibility

##  151.-152.
--> skipped

## 154. Apps with Dev Servers & Build Steps
- apps like BE web-dev server (e.g. React) cannot be transferred into Prod as they are
	- not optimized, file compilation with using npm scripts (like npm start, npm build, test, eject ...) would be resource-costly

## Creating a build-only container
- some projects require a build step, e.g. optimizations script that needs to be executed AFTER dev but BEFORE deploy
- dev setup !== prod setup
	- **e.g. ReactJS app in dev:** uses live-reloading dev server, uses unoptimized / unsupported JS feats
	- **ReactJS app in prod:** no attached server, optimized , fully browser-compatible code
- needs to be executed differently in dev & prod
	- in prod use `-alpine` image which are smaller

## Intro to Multi-Stage Builds
- one Dockerfile, multiple steps
	- stages can copy results from each other
	- you can either build the complete image or select specific stag
- instead of CMD you can use just RUN in Dockerfile
- `node` image is only needed to build optimized files (stage 1)
	- then switch to new base image `nginx:stable alpine`
	- tag first image `AS build` & then use in 2nd stage `--from=build`
	- expose port in 2nd stage only

## Build a Multi-Stage Image
`docker build -f Dockerfiles/specific.Dockerfile -t myapp ./frontend` 
- -f sets specific Dockerfile
- needs a full path of file
- at the end you still need to specify PATH for context - tells Docker which files and folders to "send" into the build process

## 158.
--> skipped

## Dev vs. Prod differences + understanding multi-stage build targets
- differences in code, e.g. different URLs
- different images for dev & prod

`docker build --target build -f Dockerfiles/specific.Dockerfile -t myapp ./frontend` 
- only runs build stage
- `FROM node:20 AS builder` --> `--target builder` 

## 161. 
--> skipped

## Module Summary & Resources
- main differences (e.g. bind-mounts)
- managed vs. own remote machines (admin/expert level)
	- + managed DB service like MongoDB Atlas
- containers can run in diff envs and only need docker for that
- multi-stage build and images
- docker locally, docker-compose, docker deployment
