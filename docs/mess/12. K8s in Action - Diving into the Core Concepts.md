## Module Introduction
### Module Content
- K8s & Testing Env Setup
- Working with K8s Objects
- Examples!

## Kubernetes does NOT manage your infrastructure
**What K8s Will Do:** 
- create your objects (e.g. Pods) and manage them
- monitor pods, re-create and scale
- utilizes provided resources to apply your config / goals
 
**What You Need To Do / Setup (i.e. what K8s requires):** 
- create the cluster and the node instances (worker + master nodes)
- setup API server, kubelet and other K8s services / software on Nodes
- create other (cloud) provider resources that might be needed (e.g. Load Balancer, Filesystems)

### What K8s IS and IS NOT
- it is not a CSP 
	- it's an open-source project
	- it does not know anything about the machines & other infra resources (LB, FS...) in either data center or a cloud (e.g. EC2 instances)
- it's not a service by a cloud service provider
	- it can be used with any provider => cloud-agnostic
- it is not restricted to any specific (cloud) service provider 
	- it can be used with any provider => cloud-agnostic
- it's not just a software you run on some machine
	- it's a framework, a collection of concepts and tools which allows to set up deployments for containerized apps
- it's not an alternative to Docker 
	- it works with (Docker) containers
- it's not a paid service
	- it's free (open-source)

### DIY Approach - Disadvantages
- we own the remote machine fully
- we are responsible for its security etc.
	- keep essentials software updated
	- manage network and security groups / firewall 
- SSHing into the machine to manage it can be annoying 
- problems when replacing failing containers etc.

### Kubermatic
- built for K8s
- open-source cluster management automation tool for K8s
- server admin tool, create all infra resources, remote machines, instances, e.g. on AWS
### Amazon EKS

## Kubernetes Local Setup & Installation Steps
- required: 
	- **cluster**: master node  + worker node(s)  + all required software/services (master: API server, scheduler, controller; worker: docker, kubelet etc.)
	- **kubectl** (= kube control) 
		- a tool for sending instructions to the cluster (e.g. a new deployment)
- **minikube** creates a single-node (master & worker node combined into one) cluster 
	- also install kubectl

## Understanding Kubernetes Objects
- K8s works with **Objects**: 1. Pods, 2. Deployments, 3. Services, 4. Volume, ...
- you can create different Objects by executing a certain command
- K8s then works with these Objects (something in a code) based on the instructions encoded in it

**Objects can be created in two different ways:** 
1. **Imperatively** and 2. **Declaratively**

### The "Pod" Object
- the smallest unit Kubernetes knows and interacts with
- Kubernetes creates Pods and Pods then hold containers
	- **Contains and runs one or multiple containers**
	- most common use-case is "one container per Pod"
- Kubernetes manages these Pods and therefore the containers
- **Pods contain shared resources** (e.g. volumes) for all Pod containers
- **Has a cluster-internal IP by default**
	- Containers inside a Pod can communicate via localhost (same as in AWS)

**For Pods to be managed for you, you need a "Controller" (e.g. a "Deployment").**
#### Pods are ephemeral
Kubernetes will start, stop and replace them as needed.
They do not persist, if removed, all data is lost -- by default. 
There are ways to change this.

### The "Deployment" Object (Resource)
- one of the key objects
- create deployment object incl. instructions about number of Pods & containers --> to create Pod objects for you
- controls one or multiple Pods
	- **set a desired target state --> K8s then changes actual state based on that**
	- define which Pods and containers to run and the number of instances
		--> Pod objects created by K8s --> Pods created by K8s --> containers started by K8s --> K8s will then place these Pods on Worker Nodes
- **deployments can be paused, deleted and rolled back ==> fail-safe**
- **deployments can be scaled dynamically** (and automatically --> feature called auto-scaling)
	- you can change the number of desired Pods as needed

Deployments manage a Pod for you, you can also create multiple Deployments.
- **You therefore typically do not control Pods directly, but instead set up a Deployment to achieve the desired end state.**

## First Deployment - Imperative Approach
When you use **imperative commands**:
```
kubectl create deployment my-app --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment my-app --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```
- You tell Kubernetes exactly what to do _right now_.
- No YAML manifests required (though you can generate them from imperative commands if needed).

### Declarative Approach
 = define the desired state in a YAML file
Then apply it: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
Kubernetes compares the current state with the YAML and adjusts accordingly.

## kubectl: Behind The Scenes
- create deployment --> send it to Master Node (Control Plane)  --> Scheduler analyzes currently running Pods and finds the best Node for the new Pod
- kubelet on Worker Node manages the Pod and Containers, starts, monitors & checks its health

## The "Service" Object (Resource)
- exposes ports to the cluster or externally - finding Pods is hard if the IP changes all the time
- Service groups Pods with a shared IP 
- Service can allow external access to Pods 	- The default (internal only) can be overwritten
**W/O Services, Pods are very hard to reach and communication is difficult.**

## Exposing Deployment with Service
minikube start && kubectl get nodes
- kubectl expose deployment k8s-first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
- kubectl get services
- minikube service k8s-first-app

## Restart Containers
after crashing pods restart automatically

## Scaling in Action
kubectl scale deployment/k8s-first-app --replicas=3
kubectl get pods

## Update Deployment
docker build -t ilouckov/k8s-first-app:2 .
docker push ilouckov/k8s-first-app:2
**kubectl describe pod | grep container**
**kubectl set image deployment/k8s-first-app k8s-first-app=ilouckov/k8s-first-app:2**
**kubectl rollout status deployment/k8s-first-app**

## Deployment Rollback
kubectl set image deployment/k8s-first-app k8s-first-app=ilouckov/k8s-first-app:3
kubectl rollout status deployment/k8s-first-app
**kubectl rollout undo  deployment/k8s-first-app**
